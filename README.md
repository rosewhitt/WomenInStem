# WomenInStem
Women In Stem is a website that I created in my AP Computer Science Principles class.
The objective was to create a functioning website using HTML that advocates for a cause that you believe in.
I am very passionate about encouraging women and girls across the world to give the STEM field a try and
decided to focus on that for this project. I went beyond the requirements and integrated Javascript into the HTML code.
